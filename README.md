# Omnidirectional-Images-as-Moving-Camera-Videos

This is the repository of paper [Omnidirectional Images as Moving Camera Videos]()

# Highlights:
1. A principled computational framework for objective quality assessment of 360Â° images.
2. We propose to represent an omnidirectional image by different moving camera videos.
3. Three viewing behavior: starting point, exploration time, scanpath are incorporated into this framework.

# Implementation version:
Matlab [oiqa_metric.m](/oiqa_metric.m)

# Usage:
git clone https://github.com/xiangjieSui/Omnidirectional-Images-as-Moving-Camera-Videos

run demo.m
